## Sample

Given your Bash aliases defined in a file like this:

```sh
# One line. With types.
# Note that just `1` is already reserved in ZSH for navigate back a directory.
alias l1='ls -1 -F'

# Wrapping names.
alias l='ls -C -F'

# Show hidden.
alias la='ls -A'

# ...
```

You can turn those into a searchable webpage that looks like this:
